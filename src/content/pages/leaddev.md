## Take your leadership skills to the next level

If you're interested in deepening your leadership capabilities, join me for my live course: **Engineering Leadership in the AI Era**.

### Learn the 3 key skills you need to be an impactful leader:

- Identifying opportunities for growth within your team and working with your team to fill these missing gaps
- Effective communication with your direct reports, peers, and upper management
- Asking for and delivering constructive, actionable feedback

**Over 100 individual contributors and managers** have already enhanced their leadership capabilities through this interactive cohort with live sessions, direct feedback, and a collaborative learning experience.

**Next session: October 21-31, 2025** (last session of 2025!)
