This course equips both new and experienced software engineering managers with the essential skills to amplify their influence and drive team performance.

**Over 100 individual contributors and managers** have already enhanced their leadership capabilities through this course. Join them and transform your approach to leadership.

## Why trust me?

I've been working with and mentoring engineers and engineering leaders from companies small and large, and I often see the same trend: a great engineer is promoted to Engineering Manager because they're a great engineer, but they're never given the necessary tools and training to succeed as an EM.

Throughout my 10+ years of experience managing engineers and engineering leaders, I have been honing and teaching my methodology for bringing the human side of management to the forefront to turn good engineers and managers into great leaders. Leadership isn't about your job title; it's about influence, and my proven methodology helps you build the influence you strive to have to make an impact on your organization and in your professional life.
