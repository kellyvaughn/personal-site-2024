## Learn the 3 key skills you need to be an impactful leader within your engineering organization, regardless of your job title

![Heading for Building Influence for Engineers & EMs](/course.jpg)

## What makes a great engineering leader?

**People remember their favorite managers and technical leads not by the technical contributions they made but by the impact they left on their career.**

The best engineering leaders are on a perpetual trail of self-improvement and recognize that great leaders build great teams. Engineers moving into management are often not taught the ropes of how to be a great leader, which can be a huge barrier to their success.

## This interactive course will teach you how to build influence as an engineering leader by focusing on three key skills:

- Identifying opportunities for growth within your team and working with your team to fill these missing gaps

- Effective communication with your direct reports, peers, and upper management

- Asking for and delivering constructive, actionable feedback

> I recently completed Kelly’s course on ‘Building Influence for Engineers and EMs’, and I’m thoroughly impressed. Days after finishing, I find myself still unpacking the wealth of knowledge and insights provided. Kelly expertly laid out the essential foundations for participating in and constructing high-performance software engineering teams. What set this course apart was its interactive nature, making it far more engaging and enjoyable than any other online course I’ve experienced. Highly recommended for those looking to elevate their team’s performance and their personal impact within the tech space.

## Why trust me?

I've been working with and mentoring engineers and engineering leaders from companies small and large, and I often see the same trend: a great engineer is promoted to Engineering Manager because they're a great engineer, but they're never given the necessary tools and training to succeed as an EM.

Throughout my 8+ years of experience managing engineers and engineering leaders, I have been honing and teaching my methodology for bringing the human side of management to the forefront to turn good engineers and managers into great leaders. Leadership isn't about your job title; it's about influence, and my proven methodology helps you build the influence you strive to have to make an impact on your organization and in your professional life.
