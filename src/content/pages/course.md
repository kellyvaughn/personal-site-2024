![Heading for Management Fundamentals for Tech Leaders](/course.jpg)

## What makes a great engineering leader?

**Tech leaders are remembered not just for their technical prowess, but for the lasting impact they have on their team's careers and success.**

This course equips both new and experienced software engineering managers with the essential skills to amplify their influence and drive team performance.

**Over 100 software engineers and engineering managers** have already enhanced their leadership capabilities through this course. Join them and transform your approach to tech leadership.

## This interactive course will teach you how to build influence as an engineering leader by focusing on three key skills:

- Identifying opportunities for growth within your team and working with your team to fill these missing gaps

- Effective communication with your direct reports, peers, and upper management

- Asking for and delivering constructive, actionable feedback

## Why trust me?

I've been working with and mentoring engineers and engineering leaders from companies small and large, and I often see the same trend: a great engineer is promoted to Engineering Manager because they're a great engineer, but they're never given the necessary tools and training to succeed as an EM.

Throughout my 8+ years of experience managing engineers and engineering leaders, I have been honing and teaching my methodology for bringing the human side of management to the forefront to turn good engineers and managers into great leaders. Leadership isn't about your job title; it's about influence, and my proven methodology helps you build the influence you strive to have to make an impact on your organization and in your professional life.
