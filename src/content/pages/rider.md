Thank you for taking the time to review this rider! I'm honored that you asked me to speak at your event, and I'm excited to explore this opportunity. I'm always open to speaking engagements, and I'm happy to help you get the most out of your event.

This rider was written to ensure we're on the same page before we get too far into our discussions. Ensuring a diverse, equitable, and inclusive conference experience is important to me, and I review all speaking opportunities through this lens.

If I say no to your event (even if you do all of the below), please don't take it personally! I often travel a lot for work so many events do not fit within my schedule.

Here we go!

## Hosting accommodations

### Speaker honorarium

- I ask for a speaker fee because I value my time (and hope you do too). My company does not send me to speak at conferences, so I have to take time off of work and projects to travel and attend. My mortgage company unfortunately doesn't accept exposure as payment, so real money is required :)
- For non-profit events, I may choose to waive this based on the conference goals and budget.

### Travel

- I ask that travel to and from the event is provided (assuming it is not local; I live in Atlanta, GA).
- I prefer to use my loyalty programs for flying and lodging. Living in Atlanta, my best option is to fly Delta, and I prefer to stay in either a Marriott or IHG hotel.

### Lodging

- I ask that lodging is provided for the full length of the event, unless the event is local!
- For events outside of the US or in a different time zone, I ask for at least one full day of lodging before the event since I'll likely be flying in a day or two before.

### Ticket

- I ask for a ticket to the full conference as a speaker. I'm not just there to speak; I'm there to learn and connect as well!

## Logistics

### Code of Conduct

- Have one! This benefits not just me but all speakers and conference attendees.

### No white-majority, all-men lineups

- Our engineering and engineering leadership community is diverse, and your speaker lineup should be too.
- I will not speak about being a woman in tech. I cannot and will not speak on behalf of all women. My experience is uniquely mine. Please avoid this question for Q&A or in a talk.

### Recordings/Intellectual Property

- For conference talks: record away! I like being able to share recordings afterwards.
- For workshops: I prefer these to not be recorded, as I want to ensure those who paid good money to be there feel there was value in attending vs. watching a replay.

### Virtual events

- I'll always prefer live virtual events over pre-recorded videos. Pre-recorded videos require idealized perfection (aka a significant mount of time recording, re-recording, and editing), and I prefer the more "human" aspect of giving a talk live.
- Please provide some level of moderation in the chat. This should align with your code of conduct.

## Final thoughts

Thank you so much for reading this! If you have any questions, you can always send me an email. Huge thank you to [Cassidy](https://cass.run/rider) for providing the template for this rider!
